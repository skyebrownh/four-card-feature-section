## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to better work with CSS Grid. This had been a weak spot in my CSS skills up to this point (I'm much better and have more experience with Flexbox).

### Continued development

I'm happy to have implemented a fully functional CSS Grid component for the responsive card section of this challenge. I hope to get more practice with CSS Grid in the future and challenge myself to build more complex layouts with it.
